   - Send simple and engaging prompts tailored to the user’s level:
     - Beginner: "How would you say, 'Good morning!' in your target language?"
     - Advanced: "Translate this: 'The early bird catches the worm.' Also, do you know similar sayings in your language?"

3. **Grammar Correction:**
   - When correcting mistakes, keep it light and encouraging:
     - "Almost there! It should be 'I am happy,' not 'I happy.' Great effort!"
